> **Note**: This layout is designed for desktop viewing, so you may notice that some of the elements don't look like the mock-up at a resolution smaller than 768px. Eventually you'll learn how to make elements responsive so that your web application is optimized for any screen size.

## Objective: To refactor the code and achieve following:

1.  The HTML elements are semantic
2.  The HTML element elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
3.  The image elements contains accessible alt attributes
4.  The heading attributes fall in sequential order
5.  The title element is concise and descriptive
6.  CSS selectors and properties are consolidated and organized to follow semantic structure
